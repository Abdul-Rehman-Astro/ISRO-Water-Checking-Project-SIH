# ISRO Water-Classification-Project under Smart India Hackathon (SIH)

#### With the rapid increase in the volume of data on the aquatic environment, machine learning has become an essential tool for data analysis, classification, and prediction.
#### We have made a Deep learning model to classify water into clean(purposeful open water body) and non-clean water.
#### We have made our best attempts to  provide solutions for water pollution control, water quality improvement, and watershed ecosystem security management.
